# The Gathering Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "Gatherings" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I aimed to have the least amount of coupling possible. I do not think I succeeded in this. I was unable to to effectivly deal with the class "gathering". It was linked to both "organizations" and "organization". 


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I spent many hours on typescript.org, as many as 6 to 8 hours. It was many hours. 


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Acually writing code and not just refferancing the documentaion I would say I spent cose to 25-30 hours, I should have budgeted more time. I still think I could improve the design if I kept trying.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> For me I would say the challenge was a 7. It was a challenge for me. I enjoyed it. I think I have to schedule more time to these assignments. I look forward to the next challenge!


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> no, i think i was able to overcome most of the obsticles I encountered.
